            // Value type as the name suggests is a datatype which when declared and assigned a value, holds the value directly on its own memory space
            // The Value type uses a heap to store the value
            // Value types data types are int, float, long, double, char, bool, decimal double etc.

            // Reference type is variable type which instead of storing the value in memory directly, stores the memory location of the actual data
            // The variable here stores the memory reference of the data and not the data directly.
            // Reference type data types are string, class, Array etc.
            // When we copy this reference type of a data type it will just copy the memory address of the data so the data so we will then have two variable pointing to the same data.
