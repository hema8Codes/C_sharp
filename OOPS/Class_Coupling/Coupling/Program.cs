            // Coupling, in Software Engineering, is a measure of how interconnected classes and subsystems are
            // Tightly Coupled Design -> so an Aplication whose classes are tightly related or dependent on each other
            // Loosely Coupled Design -> we want to minimise changes in our Application, so when we change our class we want
            // that changes to be isolated , we don't want that changes to affect other part of Application

            //  HOW DO WE DESIGN A LOOSELY COUPLED APPLICATION
            // we need to understand 
            // Encapsulation
            // The relationships between classes
            // Interfaces

            // Types of relationships
            // Inheritance
            // Composition

            // What is inheritance
            // A kind of relationship between two classes that allows one to inherit code from the other.
            // Is-A
            // eg -> A car is a Vehicle

            //Benefits
            // Code re-use
            // Polymorphic Behaviour
